I am a highly effective Database Manager looking to expand into a Cybersecurity role. I am an avid learner with passion to explore, absorb, and implement emerging technologies.

## Objective

My time at Midland Code Academy unexpectedly sparked a deep interest in cybersecurity. While I originally signed up to enhance my coding skills, I quickly found myself captivated by the challenges and complexities of protecting data and systems. It’s amazing how this experience opened my eyes to a whole new world within tech—one where problem-solving and constant learning are key. Now, cybersecurity has become a passion of mine, and I’m excited to explore where it can take me.
